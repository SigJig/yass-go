## Yet Another SQF Superscript

The Real Virtuality game engine, which serves as the backbone for majority of Bohemia Interactive games, gives 3rd party
developers the ability to mod the games through the scripting language SQF. The majority of the success of the Arma series can be attributed to its moddability, and it is a crucical aspect of the game.

However, SQF is a severely flawed langauge. It features a strange and inconsistent syntax, it has limited capabilities, and is difficult and frustrating to develop, maintain, test and debug. From years of experience, it is apparent it will remain this way, and BI developers seemingly have little to no interest in improving it.

Because of the reasons listed above, this project was created. The aim is to design and implement an improved, statically typed, and modern language, that is compiled to SQF under the hood. The compiler will handle optimizations, package managment, project structuring and support for writing addon extensions in Go.

### Status

This project is currently in the early stages of development.

So fuck off.
